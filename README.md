# Gestalt Awareness Journal

## What I Want to Build
I want to create an awareness journal that utilizes Gestalt techniques taught in my class to help individuals improve
self-awareness, personal growth, and mindfulness. This journal will serve as a digital platform for users to record their
thoughts in a quick manner to be organized later.

## More Detailed Description
The Gestalt Awareness Journal will provide users with an extremely simple, organized, yet flexible platform to document
their daily experiences, and thoughts. It will incorporate Gestalt therapy techniques, such as the "here and now" approach,
to encourage users to be present in their journaling process.

The main issue with journaling is tracking key ideas and moments in the day. With this in mind, we have created
an extremely simple application that will let you track your thoughts for later usage.

At the end of the day the user can review their thoughts as prompts for their journalling.

Key features of the Gestalt Awareness Journal will include:
- Daily one-line journal entries with customizable prompts.
- Export thoughts as PDF
- Group thoughts by date

## Background
I decided to build the Gestalt Awareness Journal after learning about an awareness technique in class.
A number of classmates brought up the issue of tracking ideas throughout the day. So from there, I wanted to create a
digital tool that could make these techniques more accessible to a wider audience.

Many people struggle with self-awareness and finding effective ways to reflect on their lives.
Gestalt therapy, with its focus on the "here and now," offers a powerful approach to achieving greater self-understanding.

## How Will You Utilize RedwoodJS?
RedwoodJS will be the foundation of this project, serving as the web framework for building the digital platform.
Its robust features for building web applications, including data handling and authentication, will enable us to create
a user-friendly and secure journaling experience.
